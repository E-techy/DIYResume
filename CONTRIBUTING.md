# 🤝 Contributing to DIYResume

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **DIYResume** 🚀

This repository is built to explore creative and technical resume formats across multiple platforms.

Before contributing, please read these rules carefully.

# 📂 1. Folder Structure Rules

You must organize your contribution properly.

## ✅ Option A: New Resume Category

If your resume format belongs to a completely new category, create a new folder at root level.

Example:

```
ar-resume/
voice-resume/
game-resume/
```

---

## ✅ Option B: Existing Category

If your resume fits an existing category, add it inside that folder.

Example:

```
pdf-resume/modern-template/
web-resume/react-portfolio/
terminal-resume/python-cli/
```

Do NOT mix unrelated formats inside the same folder.

# 🏷 2. Naming Conventions (Mandatory)

## 📁 Folder Naming

* Use lowercase letters only
* Use hyphens instead of spaces
* Keep names meaningful

✅ Correct:

* `pdf-resume`

❌ Incorrect:
